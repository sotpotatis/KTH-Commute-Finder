# SL API

This is a simple wrapper around the SL APIs that I required for the project. The APIs included are:

* Reseplanerare 3.1
* Platsuppslag 1.0

The reason I wrote my own library is because the package `sl-api` did not use the latest version of the Reseplanerare API.
It used a deprecated version that was removed and you couldn't make any requests to it.
